# **Introduction to neurons.me**

> **Empowering Users with Self-Sovereign AI**

Instead of being passively shaped by AI systems **built for corporations**, **this ecosystem** lets you **actively build and control** the intelligence that works for you.

## **Go Algorithmic.**
**Algorithms should work for you—not control you.**

- **Full transparency.** No black-box manipulation—only clear, user-driven intelligence. You **see** how the algorithm operates

**AI**  should ensure sovereignty over data and **algorithms**. Hidden models shouldn’t dictate how intelligence evolves around us.

> **The code is the ultimate truth.** If you can see the code, you can trust the system.

## **Core Projects**

| **Project**     | **Purpose**                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **All.This**    | A framework for modular **data structuring**, optimizing ML pipelines. |
| **neurons.me**  | The **intelligence core **— providing **visibility into AI processes** and dataset evolution. |
| **i.mLearning** | A system for users to **create, manage, and refine datasets** for ML. |
| **this.me**     | A user-centric system.                                       |
| **Cleaker**     | A **decentralized identity** and authentication system for dApps. |
| **Netget**      | A **peer-to-peer networking** solution for fully independent AI applications. |

## **How It Works**
A **user** structures their data then feed into **neurons.me** for deep learning. **AI** training and adaptation remain **fully visible to the user**, ensuring they understand and **control their own learning processes.**

- **Own your intelligence.** Your data trains your AI—not someone else’s business model.
- **Interoperability is key.** Every component integrates seamlessly for **user-driven deep learning**.
